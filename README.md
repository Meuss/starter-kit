# kirby-starter-kit ![alt tag](https://getkirby.com/assets/images/kirbyicon.svg)
Hey, this is my personal kirby starter kit, built so I can start building new websites quickly. Please let me know how I could make it better/if you have questions.

## SETTING UP - Checklists

### Npm packages update
`npm i -g npm-check-updates`
`npm-check-updates -u`
`npm install`

### Kirby version update
- compare kirby version from kirby>kirby.php
- if you need an update, replace the folders **kirby** and **panel** with the new ones.

### Do you need multilanguage ?
- https://getkirby.com/docs/languages/setup
- change html lang attribute

## TODOs

- add webpack
- add mobile detect to body class
- add the body default loading class and javascript logic
- add image compression to gulp flow?
- should I include multilanguage by default?
- should I include the kirby json api?
