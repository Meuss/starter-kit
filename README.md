# My :heart:Kirby:heart: Starter Kit

#####*with gulp, scss, browsersync, babel*
Hey, this is my personal kirby starter kit, built so I can start building new websites quickly. Please let me know if I should explain something better, and if you got anything you would add :bowtie:

## SETTING UP - Checklists

### Npm packages updates
